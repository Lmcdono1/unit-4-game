# unit-4-game

This game encompasses concepts of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. The objective is for the player to match their score with a random number. The player must click on crystals (without knowing their value until they are clicked) in order to match the number.

This game allows showcases front-end frameworks with building an attractive game and also uses JS and JQuery to:
1. Develop a random number for players to guess
2. Develop 4 random numbers that are assigned to the crystals, only revealed when clicked
3. Alert the player if they have won or lost depending on if their number is equal to the random number (won) or greater than the random number (lost).
4. Logs the score and resarts the game

To start this game, I pseudo coded the JS/JQuery portion to determine what functions were needed for each of the steps above.
